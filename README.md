To do:

1. Tie sensor asynchronous class into main activity (assigned: MJL68)

2. Implement GUI controls for settings pages. 

3. Implement fall event interaction w/ accessibility features. (Pretty straightforward but may have some tricky parts)

4. Implement notification functions. (Almost straight copy/paste from the sample APIs)
